This is a python3 fork of [Richard Penman's Browser Cookie](https://github.com/richardpenman/browsercookie)

# Browser Cookie #

* ***What does it do?*** Loads cookies used by your web browser into a cookiejar object.
* ***Why is it useful?*** This means you can use python to download and get the same content you see in the web browser without needing to login.
* ***Which browsers are supported?*** Currently Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Edge, Chromium, Brave, Vivaldi, and Safari.
* ***How are the cookies stored?*** All currently-supported browsers store cookies in a sqlite database in your home directory.

## Install ##
```bash
pip3 install browser-cookie3
```

## Usage ##

Here is a *dangerous* hack to extract the title from a webpage:
```python
#!python

>>> import re
>>> get_title = lambda html: re.findall('<title>(.*?)</title>', html, flags=re.DOTALL)[0].strip()
```

And here is the webpage title when downloaded normally:
```python
#!python

>>> import urllib2
>>> url = 'https://bitbucket.org/'
>>> public_html = urllib2.urlopen(url).read()
>>> get_title(public_html)
'Git and Mercurial code management for teams'
```

Now let's try with browser_cookie3 - make sure you are logged into Bitbucket in Firefox before trying this example:
```python
#!python

>>> import browser_cookie3
>>> cj = browser_cookie3.firefox()
>>> opener = urllib2.build_opener(urllib2.HTTPCookieProcessor(cj))
>>> login_html = opener.open(url).read()
>>> get_title(login_html)
'richardpenman / home &mdash; Bitbucket'
```

You should see your own username here, meaning the module successfully loaded the cookies from Firefox.

Here is an alternative example with [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/), this time loading the Chrome cookies. Again make sure you are logged into Bitbucket in Chrome before running this:
```python
#!python

>>> import browser_cookie3
>>> import requests
>>> cj = browser_cookie3.chrome()
>>> r = requests.get(url, cookies=cj)
>>> get_title(r.content)
'richardpenman / home &mdash; Bitbucket'
```

Alternatively if you don't know/care which browser has the cookies you want then all available browser cookies can be loaded:
```python
#!python

>>> import browser_cookie3
>>> import requests
>>> cj = browser_cookie3.load()
>>> r = requests.get(url, cookies=cj)
>>> get_title(r.content)
'richardpenman / home &mdash; Bitbucket'
```

Alternatively if you are only interested in cookies from a specific domain, you can specify a domain filter.
```python
#!python

>>> import browser_cookie3
>>> import requests
>>> cj = browser_cookie3.chrome(domain_name='www.bitbucket.com')
>>> r = requests.get(url, cookies=cj)
>>> get_title(r.content)
'richardpenman / home &mdash; Bitbucket'
```
## Fresh cookie files
Creating and testing a fresh cookie file can help eliminate some possible user specific issues. It also allows you to upload a cookie file you are having issus with, since you should never upload your main cookie file!
### Chrome and chromium
For linux and assumably mac:

Run `google-chrome-stable --user-data-dir=browser_cookie3 #replace google-chrome-stable with your command to start chrome/chromium` and when you close the browser you will have a new cookie file at `browser_cookie3/Default/Cookies`

If you want to share a cookie file then visit some site that will generate cookie (without logging in!), example https://www.theverge.com/ will save cookies after you accept the GDPR notice.

## Planned backwards incompatible changes for 1.0
- more sensible cookie file checking order, like first using the default defined in profiles.ini for firefox

## Contribute ##

However I only tested on a single version of each browser and so am not sure if the cookie sqlite format changes location or format in earlier/later versions. If you experience a problem please [open an issue](https://github.com/borisbabic/browser_cookie3/issues/new) which includes details of the browser version and operating system. Also patches to support other browsers are very welcome, particularly for Chrome and Internet Explorer on Windows.
